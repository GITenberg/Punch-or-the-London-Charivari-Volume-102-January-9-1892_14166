    were with Miss TROTTER?</p>

    <p><i>Culchard</i>. So I am. That is, she is going over a
    metal-worker's show-room close by, and
    I&mdash;er&mdash;preferred the open air. But didn't you say you
    were going out with the&mdash;er&mdash;PRENDERGASTS again?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> So I am. She's in the Church with BOB, so I
    said I'd come out and keep an eye on the gondola. Nothing much
    to see in <i>there</i>, you know!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>with a weary irony</i>). Only the

    <p><i>Podb.</i> That's all. And I'm feeling a bit done, you
    know. Been doing the Correr Museum all the morning, and not
    lunched yet! So Miss TROTTER's looking at ornamental
    metal-work? Rather fun that, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> For those who enjoy it. She has only been in
    there an hour, so she is not likely to come back just yet. What
    do you say to coming into S.S. Giovanni e Paolo again, with
    <i>me</i>? Those tombs form a really remarkable illustration,
    as RUSKIN points out, of the gradual decay of&mdash;</p>

    and two copper water-buckets&mdash;all of which are consigned
    to the disgusted</i> CULCHARD). Just hold these a spell till I
    come back. Thanks ever so much.... Well, Mr. PODBURY! Aren't
    you going to admire my purchases? They're real antique&mdash;or
    if they aren't, they'll wear all the better.... There, I
    believe I'll just have to run back a minute&mdash;don't you put
    those things in the gondola yet, Mr. CULCHARD, or they'll get

    You're not going?</p>

    (<i>To</i> BOB.) Ah, PRENDERGAST! lovely afternoon, isn't it?
    Delicious breeze!</p>

    <p><i>Bob</i>. (<i>shortly</i>). Can't say. Not had much of it,
    at present.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> You find these old churches rather oppressive,
    I daresay. Er&mdash;will you have a cigarette? [<i>Tenders
    case.</i></p>

    <p><i>Bob</i>. Thanks; got a pipe. (<i>He lights it.</i>)
    Where's Miss TROTTER?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> She will be here presently. By the way, my
    dear PRENDERGAST, this&mdash;er&mdash;misunderstanding between
    your sister and her is very unfortunate.</p>

    <p><i>Bob</i>. I know that well enough. It's none of <i>my</i>
    doing! And <i>you</i>'ve no reason to complain, at all
    events!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Quite so. Only, you see, we <i>used</i> to be
    good friends at Constance, and&mdash;er&mdash;until
    recently&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Bob</i>. Used we? Of course, if you say so, it's all
    right. But what are you driving at exactly?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> All I am driving at is this: Couldn't we
    two&mdash;er&mdash;agree to effect a reconciliation between the
    two ladies? So much pleasanter for&mdash;er&mdash;all
    parties!</p>

    <p><i>Bob</i>. I daresay. But how are you going to set about
    it? <i>I</i> can't begin.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Couldn't you induce your sister to lay aside
    her&mdash;er&mdash;prejudice against me? Then <i>I</i> could
    easily&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Bob</i>. Very likely&mdash;but I <i>couldn't</i>. I never
    interfere in my sister's affairs, and, to tell you the honest
    truth, I don't feel particularly inclined to make a beginning
    on your account. [<i>Strolls away.</i></p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). What a surly boor it is!
    But I don't care&mdash;I'll do him a good turn, in spite of
    himself! (Miss T. <i>returns</i>.) Do you know, I've just been
    having a chat with poor young PRENDERGAST. He seems quite cut
    up at being forced to side with his sister. I undertook
    to&mdash;er&mdash;intercede for him. Now is it quite fair, or
    like your&mdash;er&mdash;usual good-nature, to visit his
    sister's offences&mdash;whatever they are&mdash;on him?
    I&mdash;I only put it to you.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, to think now! I guess you're about the
    most unselfish Saint on two legs! Now some folks would have
    felt jealous.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Possibly&mdash;but I cannot accuse myself of
    such a failing as that.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> I'd just like to hear you accuse yourself of
    <i>any</i> failing! I don't see however you manage to act so
    magnanimous and live. I told you I wanted to study your
    character, and I believe it isn't going to take me vurry much
    longer to make up my mind about <i>you</i>. You <i>don't</i>
    suppose I'll have any time for Mr. PRENDERGAST after getting
    such a glimpse into your nature? There, help me into the
    gondola, and don't talk any more about it. Tell him to go to
    Salviati's right away.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>dejectedly, to himself</i>). I've bungled
    it! I might have <i>known</i> I should only make matters
    worse!</p>

        slowly arm-in-arm between the two columns.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> And so you went on to S. Giovanni in Bragora,
    eh? then over the Arsenal, and rowed across the lagoons to see
    the Armenian convent? A delightful day, my dear PODBURY! I hope
    you&mdash;er&mdash;appreciate the inestimable privileges
    of&mdash;of seeing Venice so thoroughly?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Oh, of course it's very jolly. Find I get a
    trifle mixed afterwards, though. And, between ourselves, I
    wouldn't mind&mdash;now and then, you know&mdash;just dawdling
    about among the shops and people, as you and the TROTTERS
    do!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> That has its charms, no doubt. But don't you
    find Miss PRENDERGAST a mine of information on Italian Art and
    History?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Don't I just&mdash;rather too <i>deep</i> for
    me, y' know! I say, isn't Miss TROTTER immense sport in the
    shops and that!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> She is&mdash;er&mdash;vivacious, certainly.
    (PODBURY <i>sighs</i>.) You seem rather dull to-night, my dear
    fellow?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Not dull&mdash;a trifle out of sorts, that's
    all. Fact is, I don't think Venice agrees with me. All this
    messing about down beastly back-courts and canals and in stuffy
    churches&mdash;it <i>can't</i> be healthy, you know! And
    they've <i>no</i> drainage. I only hope I haven't caught
    something, as it is. I've that kind of sinking feeling, and a
    general lowness&mdash;<i>She</i> says I lunch too
    heavily&mdash;but I swear it's more than that!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Nonsense, you're well enough. And why you
    should feel low, with all your advantages&mdash;in Venice as
    you are, and in constant intercourse with a mind adorned with
    every feminine gift!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Hul-lo! why, I thought you called her a
    pedantic prig?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> If I used such a term at all, it was in no
    disparaging sense. Every earnest nature presents
    an&mdash;er&mdash;priggish side at times. I know that even I
    myself have occasionally, and by people who didn't <i>know</i>
    me, of course, been charged with priggishness.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Have you, though? But of course there's nothing
    of that about <i>her</i>. Only&mdash;well, it don't signify.
    [<i>He sighs.</i></p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"
       id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Ah, PODBURY, take the good the gods provide
    you and be content! You might be worse off, believe me!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>discontentedly</i>). It's all very well for
    <i>you</i> to talk&mdash;with Miss TROTTER all to yourself. I
    suppose you're regularly engaged by this time, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Not quite. There's still a &mdash;&mdash;. And
    your probation, that's practically at an end?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> I don't know. Can't make her out. She wouldn't
    sit on me the way she does unless she <i>liked</i> me, I
    suppose. But I say, it must be awf&mdash;rather jolly for you
    with Miss TROTTER? She's got so much <i>go</i>, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> You used to say she wasn't what you call
    cultivated.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> I know I did. That's just what I like about
    her! At least&mdash;well, we <i>both</i> ought to think
    ourselves uncommonly lucky beggars, I'm sure! [<i>He sighs more
    heavily than ever.</i></p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> You especially, my dear PODBURY. In fact, I
    doubt if you're half grateful enough!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>snappishly</i>). Yes, I am, I tell you.
    <i>I</i>'m not grumbling, am I? I know as well as you do she's
    miles too good for me. Haven't I <i>said</i> so? Then what the
    devil do you keep on nagging at me for, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I am glad you see it in that light. Aren't you
    a little irritable to-night?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> No, I'm not. It's those filthy canals. And the
    way you talk&mdash;as if a girl like Miss TROTTER
    wasn't&mdash;!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I really can't allow you to lecture me. I am
    not insensible to my good-fortune&mdash;if others are. Now
    we'll drop the subject.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> I'm willing enough to drop it. And I shall turn
    in now&mdash;it's late. You coming?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Not yet. Good-night. (<i>To himself, as</i>
    PODBURY <i>departs</i>.) You insensate <i>dolt</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Good-night! (<i>To himself, as he swings

    <p>That hardy annual known as The Drury Lane Pantomime is in
    full vigour this year, its flowers of a more brilliant colour
    than ever, and its leaves, as evidenced by the book of words,
    are fresh and vigorous. In no other sense, however, does the
    Drury Lane Pantomime bear any resemblance to "a plant." There
    is no "take in" about it, except that even big Old Drury is not
    capable of holding all who would be present; and so it happens
    nightly I believe, that many are turned away from the doors
    bitterly disappointed. Such certainly was the case when the
    present deponent was installed,&mdash;without any unnecessary
    ceremony,&mdash;on a certain given night last week. "The book"
    is by the Every-knightly DRURIOLANUS and his faithful Esquire,
    HARRY NICHOLLS, who, much to everybody's regret, does not on
    this occasion appear as one of the exponents of his own work.
    There are Miss FANNIE LESLIE&mdash;too much "ie" in this name
    now, and one may ask "for why"?&mdash;Miss MARIE (not
    "MARY"&mdash;oh dear now!) LLOYD, Miss PATTIE&mdash;not PATTY
    of course&mdash;HEYWOOD, Mr. JOHN and Miss EMMA (dear me!
    <i>not</i> EMMIE!) D'AUBAN, and Messrs. HERBERT CAMPBELL as a
    grotesque monarch, Mr. DAN LENO as <i>Queen of Hearts</i>, Mr.
    FRED WALTON, wonderful in a frame as the living image of the
    <i>Knave of Hearts</i>, and a crowd of clever people. But among
    the entire <i>dramatis personæ</i>, first and foremost, both
    the least and the greatest, is the impersonator of
    <i>Humpty-Dumpty</i> himself, the <i>Yellow Dwarf</i> alias
    Little TICH, who shares with the gorgeous spectacle and the
    exquisite combination of colours in Scene Eight, <i>The
    Wedding</i>, the first honours of the Great Drury Lane Annual.
    It is emphatically a Pantomime for children to see and to
    enjoy. The action is so rapid, song succeeds dance, and dance
    succeeds song, and permutations and combinations of colour are
    so brilliant and so frequent, that anyone who wants full change
    for his money and a bonus into the bargain, will find it in the
    return he will get for his outlay on visiting the Drury Lane
    Annual. And now about the Harlequinade. The "Opening," as it
    used to be called, which, terminating with the Grand
    Transformation Scene, ought to be, theoretically at least, only
    the introduction to the real business of the evening, that is,
    the "Pantomime business," concludes at 10·45, and allows
    three-quarters of an hour for what is called "the Double
    Harlequinade"&mdash;which consists of one old-fashioned English
    Pantomime-scene, followed by a comparatively modern&mdash;for
    'tis not absolutely "new and original"&mdash;French
    Pantomime-scene, and this arrangement seems like, so to speak,
    pitting English Joey against French Pierrot. This friendly
    rivalry has had the effect of waking up the traditional
    Grimaldian spirit of Pantomime, and Mr. HARRY PAYNE's scene,
    besides coming earlier than usual, is, in itself, full of fun
    of the good old school-boyish kind; and if the Public, as Jury,
    is to award a palm to either competitor, then it must give a
    hand&mdash;which is much the same thing as "awarding a
    palm"&mdash;to its old friend, HARRY PAYNE, who, with TULLY
    LEWIS as <i>Pantaloon</i>, has pulled himself together, and
    given us a good quarter of an hour of genuine Old English
    Pantomime, compared with which the other, though its fooling is
    excellent in its own way, is only comic <i>ballet d'action</i>
    after the style of <i>Fun in a Fog</i>. I think that was the
    title, but am not sure, of the gambols with which the
    MARTINETTI <i>troupe</i> used to entertain us. The new and
    improved style of ballet-dancing introduced by the now
    celebrated <i>pas de quatre</i> at the Gaiety, is charming, as
    here and now represented by Miss MABEL LOVE and her graceful
    companions.</p>

    unable to ascertain the existence of any objection to the
    opinion that this Pantomime possesses staying power sufficient
    to carry itself on for an extra long run of several months over
    Easter, and, maybe, up to Whitsuntide. There is but one
    DRURIOLANUS, and the Pantomime is his Profit! The two authors
    have achieved what "all the King's horses and all the King's
    men" (not of Cambridge, of course) could not effect!&mdash;they
    have set <i>Humpty-Dumpty</i> on his legs again! And so
    congratulations to "all concerned"! And, without prejudice to

    <i>Pipchin</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Dr. T.</i> You could not, JOSEPH, put before you a better
    model than the boy whose post you assume, in consequence of his
    going to the Upper School; young HARTY, I mean, a boy who was
    ever a pattern of propriety, and one absolutely to be depended
    upon to maintain the prestige of the school,
    and&mdash;ahem!&mdash;the authority of the Masters, in every
    contingency.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. S.</i> In <i>every</i> contingency, JOSEPH. How
    unlike that talented, but untrustworthy, senior of his, and of
    yours, WILL GLADSTONE; a lad whose leadership you once
    acknowledged, but whose pernicious influence, I am happy to
    find, you have lately quite cast off.</p>

    our time a <i>leetle</i> reminiscent of ruder, and more Radical
    days?</p>

    <p><i>Master Joe</i>. Perhaps so, Sir, perhaps so. Let me then
    say that "<i>Ego primam tollo, nominor quoniam Leo</i>" is a
    very pretty maxim for lions&mdash;and jackals. The former
    <i>rôle</i> I may not yet have risen to, but I'm hanged if I'll
    stoop to the latter.</p>

    <p><i>Dr. T.</i> Quite so, quite so! At any rate, not in such a
    questionable <i>Leonina Societas</i>. Remember, also, JOSEPH,
    what an awful example you have in young GRANDOLPH, with whom,
    at one time, you seemed a little intimate. You have only to
    reflect upon <i>his fiasco</i>, "to have the counsels of
    prudence borne in imperatively upon your mind, and the lesson
    will not be the less impressively taught if it is remembered
    that GRANDOLPH will be on the spot to take note of and profit
    by any mistakes that may be committed by his more deserving and
    successful rival."</p>

    <p><i>Master Joe</i> (<i>aside</i>). Lessons all round, eh?
    Seems to me all this grandmotherly advice is wondrous like a
    "wigging" in disguise. Perhaps they'll find I'm better at
    teaching than learning.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. S.</i> <i>Cavendo tutus</i>, JOSEPH, safe by
    caution. The motto of your predecessor. You cannot do better
    than take it as your own.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>With a spice of <i>Tristram Shandy</i>, a dash of
    <i>Ferdinand Count Fathom</i>, and none the worse for the
    quaint flavouring thus given to the style and manner of the
    romance, <i>The Blue Pavilions</i> by "Q." is about as good a
    tale of rapid dramatic and exciting adventure as the Baron
    remembers to have read,&mdash;for some time at least. There is
    in it little enough of love, though that little is well and
    prettily told, but there is no lack of fighting at long odds
    and at short intervals, of hairbreadth escapes, and of such
    chances by land and sea as keep the reader, all agog, hurrying
    on from point to point, anxious to see what is to happen next,
    and how the expected is to eventuate unexpectedly. The story is
    for the most part told in a humorous
    devil-may-care-believe-it-or-not-as-you-like sort of way which
    compels attention, occasionally raises a smile, and always
    excites curiosity. As a one-barrel novel, this ought to score a
    gold right in the centre.</p>

    <p>The writer of a little leader in the <i>Daily News</i> of
    last Wednesday seems to have been rather hard-up for a subject
    when he fell foul of the Messrs. MACMILLAN's cheap re-issue of
    <i>A Jest-Book</i>, compiled many years ago by <i>Mr.
    Punch's</i> MARK LEMON, "Uncle MARK," who brought the ancient
    <i>Joe Miller</i> up to that particular date. It was the last
    of the jest-books, and they are now quite out of fashion. A
    quarter of a century hence, no doubt, the fortunate possessor
    of one of these little books will come out with many a new
    jest, and be esteemed quite an original wit.</p>

    <p>It would have been well for the writer of the
    above-mentioned leaderette had he referred to the ninth of
    ELIA's <i>Popular Fallacies</i>, and been thereby reminded how
    "a pun is a pistol let off at the ear; and not a feather to
    tickle the intellect." The Baron is prepared to admit that the
    lesson to be learned from this delightful Essay of CHARLES
    LAMB's is, that a pun once let off, has fizzled off, and cannot
    be repeated with its first effect. Now the honest historian of
    this, or of any pun, must reproduce in his narrative all the
    circumstances of time, place, and individuality that gave it
    its point; but the effect of the pun, the Baron ventures to
    think, it is impossible to convey in print to the reader, read
    he never so wisely, nor however vividly graphic may be the
    description. Yet if this same reader possesses the art of
    reading aloud, with some approach to the dramatic Dickensian
    manner, then, given an appreciative audience, it is probable
    that the pun itself would not lose much in recital. At best,
    however, the crispness of the original salt is impaired, though
    the flavour is not lost by keeping, and the enjoyment of it
    must depend on the new seasoning provided by the reciter. Of
    course, its piquancy may have been staled by too frequent
    use&mdash;but "this is another story." After all, is a
    jest-book meant to be taken seriously? A question which
    "<i>nous donne à penser</i>," quoth</p>

    <p>In continuation of his interesting notes of incidents
    connected with the gathering of Ministers for the last Cabinet
    Council, Our Special Reporter states that the only
    <i>contretemps</i> arose in connection with the arrival of Mr.
    GOSCHEN. On alighting from his <i>coupé</i> the CHANCELLOR of
    the EXCHEQUER handed the driver a dirty crumpled piece of
    paper.</p>

    <p>"Hi! wot's this?" shouted the Cabman.</p>

    <p>"A one-pound note," said the CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER,
    blandly; "give me the change."</p>

    <p>"Oh, no you don't," said the Cabman; "you try that on in the
    City, young feller. This is too far West."</p>

    <p>Mr. GOSCHEN, evidently annoyed, carefully selected a
    worn-out shilling, and tossing it to the man, stalked haughtily
    into the Treasury. A moment later he hurriedly opened the door
    and looked out for the Cabman, but he had gone. It was
    understood, Our Reporter says, that the Right Hon. Gentleman
    had thought of a repartee.</p>

    <p>The Morning Papers announce, with tantalising brevity, that
    "Lord STRATHEDEN AND CAMPBELL has (<i>sic</i>) returned to
    Bruton Street from Berlin." We are in a position to add that
    the occasion of the noble Lords' journey to Berlin was of
    international interest. It is no secret at the Foreign Office
    that their Lordships have for some time been uneasy at the turn
    events are taking in the East. They have endeavoured to
    disguise from each other their perturbed feelings. But
    STRATHEDEN felt that CAMPBELL's eye was upon him, whilst
    CAMPBELL at last abandoned the futile effort of dissembling his
    uneasiness under the cold steel-grey glance of STRATHEDEN. They
    finally agreed that the best thing they could do was to set
    forth for Berlin, making secret <i>détours</i> in order to call
    at other of the principal capitals, and confer with the Foreign
    Ministers. The result, we are pleased to learn, has been most
    beneficial, and has, so to speak, contributed a hodful of
    mortar to the foundation on which rests the peace of
    Europe.</p>

    <p>Mrs. RAMSBOTHAM is disposed to regard HOMER as over-rated.

    <p>Mr. STEAD has been taking into his confidence a universe
    thrilled with interest, with respect to certain presentiments
    which from time to time have struck his mind. One he dates in
    October, 1883, at which time he was sub-editor of an evening
    journal which Mr. JOHN MORLEY then edited. He had, he records,
    a presentiment that at an early approaching date, Mr. MORLEY
    would have quitted the establishment&mdash;dead Mr. STEAD
    genially anticipated&mdash;and that he would reign in Stead. In
    view of the public interest involved in these confessions, we
    have interviewed a certain Right Hon. Gentleman as to his
    susceptibility to presentiments.</p>

    <p>"Well," he replied, "they are not usual with me; but I
    remember that for some time before the date mentioned, I felt
    that either Mr. STEAD or I must leave the paper."</p>

    London Fog lately, I, for one, shood like to kno when we did
    have one. As for its orful effecks upon tempers, speshally
    female ones, Well, it's about enuff to drive a pore Waiter, let
    alone a hard-workin, middel-aged Husband, stark staring
    mad!</p>

    </div>

    <p>However, thank goodness, I've got one werry grand xception,
    and he reglar cheers me up with his constant good humer.</p>

    <p>I need ardly say as it's my old Amerrycan friend, who has
    cum back to the Grand Hotel again, jest for to see what a reel
    London Winter is like, and he bears it all, fog and all,
    splendidly. He was jest in time to see Lord MARE's Sho from one
    of our best front winders, and if he didn't sit there and larf
    away as the pore soddened and soaked persession parsed by,
    speshally at the Lord MARE's six gennelmen with their padded
    carves and pink silk stockins, I never seed a gennelman larf.
    "Why on earth, Mr. ROBERT," he says to me, "why don't they have
    it in the bewtifool Summer, for it's reelly a very splendid
    performunce?" To which I replied, rather smartly, becoz I was
    naterally rayther cross, "Becoz it has allers bin held on the
    same honnerd day since the rain of Lord Mare ALLWINE, who
    rained sewen hunderd years ago." "And has probably rained ewer
    since," he larfingly replied, as he went out.</p>

    <p>He thinks London a fine place for Theaters, and went sumware
    amost ewery nite afore the Fog begun; but that rayther tried
    him, speshally in the middle of the day; so he harsked me to
    tell him, from my long xperience, what was the best posserbel
    Lunch with which to fite agenst it. So I pulled myself
    together, and told him one of my good stories:&mdash;"One of
    our werry best City Judges, who is passed and gone, used to
    have a fat Buck sent to him wunce a year by the QUEEN, from
    Windsor Forest. He didn't care werry much for Wenson hisself,
    so he goes to BRING AND RYMER, wich is potical sort o' name,
    but it is the Turtel Firm, and he xchanges his Fat Buck for
    Turtel Lunches all through the cold, cold Winter, and they kep
    him helthy and strong for years."</p>

    <p>"Then bring me one of his Lordship's Lunches at 2 o'clock
    sharp, to-day," said he, "and I'll try it." So I took him a
    scrumpshus bason of thick Turtel, and a pint Bottel of CLICKO's
    rich Shampane, and he finisht the lot, and said, "Bring me
    xactly the same splendid lunch ewery day the fog lastes." And I
    did; and he told me as how it enabeld him to face it
    bravely.</p>

    <p>Well, now for my foggy story. On that orful Toosday as ewer
    was, I was a going to cross Cheapside near the Post Office,
    when a stout elderly Lady arsked me to see her over, and, just
    as we got to the Statty, in the middel of the road, down she
    fell, and dragged me down with her. A most kind Perliceman
    rushed to our asistance, and saved us both. I then, luckily,
    got her a Cab, and took her home to &mdash;&mdash; Square, and,
    after paying the Cabby jest what he chose to arsk, she arsked,
    with a sweet smile, if I shood be offended if she gave me jest
    a triful for praps saving her life, as she said. I told her, as
    I was only a pore Waiter, I was used to tips and strays; so she
    gave me a reel gold sovering, and a good arty squeeze of the
    hand, and paid the Cabby to take me home, and finisht by
    saying, "If you ever want a triful, Sir, you know where to get
    it." And all I has to add is, that I thinks as my better arf
    mite have been jest a leetel more grayshus, as I told her, with
    amost tears in my eyes, of the graitfool conduck of the Lady of
    &mdash;&mdash; Square.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
